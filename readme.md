## MacOS VMware Recovery Creator
***
Author and Developer : Krish Kansara

This script allows you to create a virtual hard disk (vmdk) with MacOS recovery in it. Which allows you to install MacOS on your Virtual Machine.

Here in example I am using VMware Workstation 17.

You can find how to configure and use my script in the <a href="https://github.com/btrhf/MacOS_Recovery_Image_VM/wiki" target="_blank">Wiki</a> section.
